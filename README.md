# OOPsConcepts
Class- It is a blueprint or the design which defines the objects and their behaviour.
Example- Human is a class with specifications like name, age, height, eyecolor and their behaviours like speak(), eat(), walk(), work(), etc.
But we need a constructor to construct or build the objects of type Human class.

Car myCar = new Car();
In Heap, Car refernce is stored i.e. the address

In Stack, main(), local variables,myCar, etc are stored. Once the method execution is completed, the place holder is deleted from the stack.

**Dependency Association-**
Eg: There is a Vehicle class which has 3 methods--> startEngine(), stopEngine(), accelerate(). Now there is a Driver class which takes Vehicle object as a parameter and uses accelerate() method which means Driver class is dependent on Vehicle class object to perform its drive operation.

**Composition Association-**
